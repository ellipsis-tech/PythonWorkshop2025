    "# Ellipsis Python Workshop Practice Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome, Freshmen! To help you solidify your understanding of the concepts we've covered, we've prepared a set of practice questions. These questions are designed to give you hands-on experience with different aspects of Python programming. Each question will focus on a specific topic we've discussed, such as variables, data types, basic operations, strings, conditional statements, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, type conversion, and formatted string literals (f-strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "By working through these exercises, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and manipulate various data types\n",
    "- Perform basic arithmetic operations\n",
    "- Work with strings and string methods\n",
    "- Implement conditional logic using if, elif, and else\n",
    "- Use loops to repeat actions and iterate over sequences\n",
    "- Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable code\n",
    "- Create and manipulate lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- Convert data between different types\n",
    "- Format strings using f-strings for readable output\n",
    "\n",
    "These practice questions will help you build a strong foundation in Python and prepare you for more advanced topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the best way to learn programming is by doing, so don't hesitate to experiment and try out different solutions.\n",
