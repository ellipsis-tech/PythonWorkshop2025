    "Welcome, Freshmen! To help you solidify your understanding of the concepts we've covered, we've prepared a set of practice questions. These questions are designed to give you hands-on experience with different aspects of Python programming. Each question will focus on a specific topic we've discussed, such as variables, data types, basic operations, strings, conditional statements, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, type conversion, and formatted string literals (f-strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "By working through these exercises, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and manipulate various data types\n",
    "- Perform basic arithmetic operations\n",
    "- Work with strings and string methods\n",
    "- Implement conditional logic using if, elif, and else\n",
    "- Use loops to repeat actions and iterate over sequences\n",
    "- Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable code\n",
    "- Create and manipulate lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- Convert data between different types\n",
    "- Format strings using f-strings for readable output\n",
    "\n",
    "These practice questions will help you build a strong foundation in Python and prepare you for more advanced topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the best way to learn programming is by doing, so don't hesitate to experiment and try out different solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "As an aspiring alchemist, you need to keep track of the ingredients you have added into your brewing cauldron. Your task is to create a program that allows you to manage your cauldron using a dictionary.\n",
    "The cauldron can only hold up to a total of 50.0 units of power\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Instructions:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty dictionary called `cauldron`.\n",
    "2. Write a function `add_ingredient` that takes two parameters:\n",
    "    - `name` which is a string variable that contains the name of the ingredient\n",
    "    - `unit` which is a float variable that contains the amount of power the ingredient contains \n",
    "    - This function should add the ingredient to the `cauldron` dictionary or update the power if the ingredient already exists.\n",
    "    - If adding the ingredient would exceed the limit of the cauldron, print an error message instead.\n",
    "3. Write a function `remove_ingredient` that takes one parameter:\n",
    "    - `name`which is a string variable to identify the ingredient with \n",
    "    - This function should remove the ingredient from the cauldron ENTIRELY if it exists, or print a message if it does not.\n",
    "4. Write a function `get_total_power` that does not take in any parameter:\n",
    "    - This function should return the total power of all the ingredients in the cauldron."
